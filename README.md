This is a plugin for vim that allows you to easily add imports within a groovy, grails or java project.

## Installation ##

### Vundle (http://github.com/gmarik/vundle) ###

Include the following line in your .vimrc

    Bundle 'sjurgemeyer/vimport'

Then, run

    :BundleInstall


### Pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) ###

Clone the plugin's git repository

    git clone git://github.com/sjurgemeyer/vimport.git ~/.vim/bundle/vimport

You can also just copy the files the old fashioned way, but I don't condone that type of behavior
